    <h1>COSC2196 (Introduction to Information Technology) - Assignment 1</h1>

<h3><strong>Personal Information</strong></h3>
   Name: Wilson Luc<br>
   Student Number: s3858342<br>
   Email address: wilsonluc09@gmail.com<br>
   Basic background: Australian nationality (Cantonese culture)<br>
   Education to date: Monash University (Computer Science - Incomplete)<br>
   Languages spoken: English, Cantonese, Chinese<br>
   Fact about yourself: My favourite sport is badminton. I've played it on and off for the past 7 years, and at a point in time I was frequently hosting large badminton sessions with friends on a weekly basis<br>

<h3><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h3>
  <p>My interest in IT mainly lies in the programming and networking/security areas of the industry. A particular event that sparked my interest in the IT field was in 2013-2014 where I had the most enjoyable years at school learning how to program as well as design games. These classes allowed me to express my creativity in a number of ways I had never thought of before. Although these classes only ever taught me the very basics of C and C++, these were enough to spark my interest. Ever since then, I've become very comfortable with Python, have a good grasp of MIPS assembly language, and am currently in the process of learning Java.</p>

  <p>I chose to come to RMIT as I saw it as a great opportunity to learn a lot more about my course and develop it, as well as establish connections with many like-minded peers. On top of this, I enjoy the way RMIT approaches its course, more specifically how well the course is structured. The core units seem to align with what I believe are important in the industry, and I believe they will set me up for success. </p>

  <p>My expectations for my time at university are to establish a healthy work-life balance, develop habits which help facilitate independent learning, as well as form new connections with my peers. In terms of skills, I hope to be able to expand my knowledge about the workings of Java to a level which is comparable or even higher to what I have with Python. I also hope to not only pick up a plethora of new skills, but achieve mastery over them, in the hopes that they will prepare me for the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h3>
    <p>The three tests I took were the following:<br>
       1. Myers-Briggs (https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)<br>
       2. Learning Style (http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml)<br>
       3. Big Five Personality test (https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)

   <p>The result from my Myers-Briggs test showed that I am a ISFJ type (Defender). ISFJs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills', which I feel is mostly true. If I come across subjects or topics at school which I have little interest in, I often neglect them, often leading to my own downfall. On the other hand, when coming across topics which I enjoy or have a passion for, I find it extremely easy to stay motivated and keep on track, often working for long periods of time without feeling the need to take a break. I also agree with the fact that I have a strong sense of fairness, and will do anything possible to uphold commitments.<br>

   <p>After taking this test, I moved on to a Learning Style quiz. The results showed that I leaned ever so slightly towards being a tacile learner, but would also be receptive to auditory learning. I agree with the sentiment of being a tactile learner, learning best when doing activities which involve building, moving or drawing. I find it much easier to memorise important facts when pacing around my room, or when repeating sentences to myself, and find it quite hard to sit still or learn without becoming distracted or fidgety.<br>

   <p>The last test I took was the Big Five personality test. It used my score to split my personality into five categories; Openness (37.5%), Conscientiousness (56%), Extraversion (42%), Agreeableness (65%) and Neuroticism (52%). I felt as though this test was the least accurate of the three, placing my Conscientiousness quite high on the scale. Although I agreed with the idea that people who score highly in this category are often determined, I was reluctant to say that I am organised, and often easily get sidetracked, contrary to the test's description. On the other hand, it scored me quite highly in Agreeableness; the ability to put others' needs ahead of their own, and get a lot of pleasure from serving or taking care of others. This also synced up quite well with the Myers-Briggs test, which had a similar idea.

  <p>Previously in team environments, I presented many ideas to groups, but often lacked the ability to speak up during team discussions, perhaps due to my introverted nature. On top of this, I take a while to open up to group members, but after a certain period of time, I have no issue in forming friendly relationships with them. Another issue that has previously popped up for me is being overloaded with work, perhaps due to my lack of inclination to object to roles or tasks that the group has already assigned. Although I have these qualities, I'm usually very easy to work with and will let many mistakes slide.

  <p>When forming a team, I find it important to have at least 1 member take a 'leader' role, with a clear hierarchy of positions within the group. Communication-wise, I need to ensure that I speak up more, as oftentimes I will provide ideas or suggestions which will not be noted. I also find it optimal to agree on a mutual method communication as well as very clearly defined tasks upon the formation of a group, so I will need to keep in mind to bring these ideas up at an appropriate time. Apart from these ideas, I usually take criticism quite harshly, and so I need to remind myself that any criticisms are for the bettering of the task, and not aimed directly at me.</p>
