    <h3><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h3>
    <p>My interest in IT mainly lies in the programming and networking/security areas of the industry. A particular event that sparked my interest in the IT field was in 2013-2014 where I had the most enjoyable years at school learning how to program as well as design games. These classes allowed me to express my creativity in a number of ways I had never thought of before. Although these classes only ever taught me the very basics of C and C++, these were enough to spark my interest. Ever since then, I've become very comfortable with Python, have a good grasp of MIPS assembly language, and am currently in the process of learning Java.</p>

    <p>I chose to come to RMIT as I saw it as a great opportunity to learn a lot more about my course and develop it, as well as establish connections with many like-minded peers. On top of this, I enjoy the way RMIT approaches its course, more specifically how well the course is structured. The core units seem to align with what I believe are important in the industry, and I believe they will set me up for success. </p>
