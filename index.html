    <h3><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h3>
    My interest in IT mainly lies in the programming and networking/security areas of the industry. A particular event that
    sparked my interest in the IT field was in 2013-2014 where I had the most enjoyable years at school learning
    how to program as well as design games. These classes allowed me to express my creativity in a number of ways I had never thought of before. Although these classes only ever taught me the very basics of C and C++, these were
    enough to spark my interest. Ever since then, I've learned Python quite in depth, have a good grasp of MIPS assembly language, and am currently in the process of learning Java.<br>

    I chose to come to RMIT as I saw it as a great opportunity to learn a lot more about my course and develop it, as well as establish connections with many like-minded peers.
