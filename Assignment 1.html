<h3><strong>Personal Information</strong></h3>
   Name: Wilson Luc<br>
   Student Number: s3858342<br>
   Email address: wilsonluc09@gmail.com<br>
   Basic background: Australian nationality (Cantonese culture)<br>
   Education to date: Monash University (Computer Science - Incomplete)<br>
   Languages spoken: English, Cantonese, Chinese<br>
   Fact about yourself: My favourite sport is badminton. I've played it on and off for the past 7 years, and at a point in time I was frequently hosting large badminton sessions with friends on a weekly basis<br>

<h3><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h3>
  <p>My interest in IT mainly lies in the programming and networking/security areas of the industry. A particular event that sparked my interest in the IT field was in 2013-2014 where I had the most enjoyable years at school learning how to program as well as design games. These classes allowed me to express my creativity in a number of ways I had never thought of before. Although these classes only ever taught me the very basics of C and C++, these were enough to spark my interest. Ever since then, I've become very comfortable with Python, have a good grasp of MIPS assembly language, and am currently in the process of learning Java.</p>

  <p>I chose to pursure a degree in IT at RMIT because I saw it as a great opportunity to learn a lot more about my course and develop it, as well as establish connections with many like-minded peers. On top of this, I enjoy the way RMIT approaches its course, more specifically how well the course is structured. The core units seem to align with what I believe are important in the industry, and I believe they will set me up for success. </p>

  <p>My expectations for my time at university are to establish a healthy work-life balance, develop habits which help facilitate independent learning, as well as form new connections with my peers. In terms of skills, I hope to be able to expand my knowledge about the workings of Java to a level which is comparable or even higher to what I have with Python. I also hope to not only pick up a plethora of new skills, but achieve mastery over them, in the hopes that they will prepare me for the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Ideal Job: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41068581?type=standard#searchRequestToken=b6f8a96d-5008-4927-a2a8-de7ae8478778">Mobile Application and Web Developer</a></strong></h3>
  <p>Backup link: <a href="https://github.com/wilsonluc/wilsonluc.github.io/blob/master/Mobile%20Application%20and%20Web%20Developer%20Job%20in%20Melbourne%20-%20SEEK.jpeg?raw=true"></a>
  <p>The role entails the ability to design an iOS or Android application. The company creates a large variety of products, such as audio devices or security cameras, and they want an employee capable of designing mobile applications to enhance them, perhaps in the hopes of creating a simplistic mobile interface which can access or control their products. This job is appealing because it gives me a lot of creative freedom to not only program an application how I want, but also design the UI with a certain level of flexibility. On top of this, it would be very satisfying to know that there will be people relying on this sort of application for the bettering of their daily lives.

  <p>The are a number of requirements of this role. The employee must be able to use React and/or React Native experience, GraphQL, Postgres/Elasticsearch, GIT, and have cloud experience. React gives users the ability to banlessly create interactive UIs, which functions under a JavaScript library. GraphQL is a data query and manipulation language for APIs. Postgres is a relational database management system. Finally GIT is a version-control system for tracking changes in source code. Additionally, Pixel Technologies wants an employee who "has excellent written and spoken English skills", a good "problem solver with strong organisational and time management skills", "a willigness to share ideas and collaborate", as well as a keen "eye for design to create a great customer UI experience".</p>

  <p>Out of all these programming-related requirements, the only one I have experience in is PostgresQL, as I studied a lot RDBMS while undertaking a Computer Science degree. I believe that I have all the non-technical requirements(grew up in Australia and believe I fit the mold), but am very motivated to learn all the skills that would be required in this field. All the skills which I do not currently have can be learnt through a variety of free online resources, particularly on websites like YouTube or Stack Overflow. I believe that each of these skills could be learnt in roughly a 4 month period and a bit longer to achieve expertise in. </p>

   <p>The result from my Myers-Briggs test showed that I am a ISFJ type (Defender). ISFJs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills', which I feel is mostly true. If I come across subjects or topics at school which I have little interest in, I often neglect them, often leading to my own downfall. On the other hand, when coming across topics which I enjoy or have a passion for, I find it extremely easy to stay motivated and keep on track, often working for long periods of time without feeling the need to take a break. I also agree with the fact that I have a strong sense of fairness, and will do anything possible to uphold commitments.<br>

   <p>After taking this test, I moved on to a Learning Style quiz. The results showed that I leaned ever so slightly towards being a tacile learner, but would also be receptive to auditory learning. I agree with the sentiment of being a tactile learner, learning best when doing activities which involve building, moving or drawing. I find it much easier to memorise important facts when pacing around my room, or when repeating sentences to myself, and find it quite hard to sit still or learn without becoming distracted or fidgety.<br>

   <p>The last test I took was the Big Five personality test. It used my score to split my personality into five categories; Openness (37.5%), Conscientiousness (56%), Extraversion (42%), Agreeableness (65%) and Neuroticism (52%). I felt as though this test was the least accurate of the three, placing my Conscientiousness quite high on the scale. Although I agreed with the idea that people who score highly in this category are often determined, I was reluctant to say that I am organised, and often easily get sidetracked, contrary to the test's description. On the other hand, it scored me quite highly in Agreeableness; the ability to put others' needs ahead of their own, and get a lot of pleasure from serving or taking care of others. This also synced up quite well with the Myers-Briggs test, which had a similar idea.

  <p>Previously in team environments, I presented many ideas to groups, but often lacked the ability to speak up during team discussions, perhaps due to my introverted nature. On top of this, I take a while to open up to group members, but after a certain period of time, I have no issue in forming friendly relationships with them. Another issue that has previously popped up for me is being overloaded with work, perhaps due to my lack of inclination to object to roles or tasks that the group has already assigned. Although I have these qualities, I'm usually very easy to work with and will let many mistakes slide.

  <p>When forming a team, I find it important to have at least 1 member take a 'leader' role, with a clear hierarchy of positions within the group. Communication-wise, I need to ensure that I speak up more, as oftentimes I will provide ideas or suggestions which will not be noted. I also find it optimal to agree on a mutual method communication as well as very clearly defined tasks upon the formation of a group, so I will need to keep in mind to bring these ideas up at an appropriate time. Apart from these ideas, I usually take criticism quite harshly, and so I need to remind myself that any criticisms are for the bettering of the task, and not aimed directly at me.</p>

<h3><strong>Project Idea: Sudoku Solver</strong></h3>

Something related to mobile app dev
  <p><b>Overview: </b>Sudoku is a puzzle where players insert numbers into nine 3x3 grids connected to each other, forming a 9x9 grid in total. The goal is to fill the Sudoku puzzle with number in a way such that every number appears exactly <b>once</b> in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square. The goal is to create a program to automatically solve a Sudoku puzzle given a valid input. It will only be able to handle a standard 9x9 Sudoku format. The user can be asked if they want the problem to be solved through bruteforce or pre-existing Sudoku techniques. Each fixed number in the Sudoku puzzle must be input by the user.</p>

 <p><b>Motivation: </b>Ever since I was first introduced to Sudoku as a child by my father, I've been fascinated by the concept that most unique Sudoku puzzles have only one specific solution. What has impressed me even more than this is the fact that more than six sextillion (6.67*10<sup>21</sup>) unique combinations exist in a standard Sudoku puzzle. Although so many unique Sudoku puzzles exist, there are websites that have the ability to take these and solve them in almost no time at all. As a result, this has inspired me to challenge my programming knowledge to create something that can rival these websites in terms of speed.</p>

 ============================

 <p><b>Description: As somewhat explained in overview, the user </b></p> 500 - Detailed description of the features of the product or service

 <p><b>Tools and technologies: </b>A sudoku solver can be programmed in a number of different programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, etc. Any programming language which has either tables or arrays which also have an intrinsic way of iterating through elements should be able to accomplish this. In terms of hardware, any computer that can install an compiler should suffice; even the lowest of hardware specifications should be able to handle it. If trying to use image recognition in order to read in a Sudoku puzzle and convert it into a table/array, extensions may be needed (e.g. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/">OpenCV for Python</a>).</p>

 <p><b>Skills required: </b>The most important skill which would lead to this project's success would be familiarity and expertise in the chosen programming language. On top of this, all the complex Sudoku techniques would need to be implemented into the program, and converted into code that the compiler can use. Understanding of the workings of an extension which allow the program to use image recognition to recreate the Sudoku puzzle would be preferential. No special hardware will be required for a Sudoku solver. In terms of how difficult it would be to find the skills, software and hardware required, it would be quite easy. Anyone who is comfortable with the specified programming language would have no issues coding this, most of the software required is open source, and no hardware apart from any functional computer is required.</p>

 <p><b>Outcome: </p> 100 - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?
